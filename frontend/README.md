# Blog Website Frontend

This is the frontend for the blog website. It interacts with the FastAPI backend via REST API.

## Features
- User authentication (login/register)
- View all blog posts
- Create, edit, delete own posts
- Admin: manage all posts and users

## Setup
You can use any static server to serve the frontend, or use a tool like Vite/React for a modern UI. For a simple start, open `index.html` in your browser and update the API URL as needed.
